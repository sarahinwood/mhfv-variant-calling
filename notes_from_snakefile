# setting ploidy determines the lowest allele frequency kept - https://sites.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/legacy-gatk-forum-discussions/2017-06-18-2017-01-18/9687-Regarding-ploidy-in-Haplotyple-Caller-for-multiple-replicates-of-pooled-RNAseq
    # when p=2 (diploid, 1 individual) lowest freq. is 50%
    # when p=10 (diploid, 5 individuals) lowest freq. is 10% i.e. heterozygous in 1/5 samples
    # when p=5 (haploid, 5 invididuals) lowest freq. is 20% i.e. main allele in 1/5 samples
    # when p=1 (haploid, 1 individual) lowest freq. is 100% i.e. main allele in sample

# setting ploidy to 1 (*number of pooled samples) for a haploid genome allows for calling of the dominant polymorphism
    # could then variant call again with ploidy unset to detect de novo mutations/multiple acquisition sources - looks at within host variation
    # consider though that GATK may assume a ploidy of 2 if this is not set explicityly?
    # to get 1 alternate allele set max_genotype_count to ploidy+1 (https://sites.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/legacy-gatk-forum-discussions/2018-04-11-2017-12-02/11305-Ploidy-level-in-HaplotypeCaller-in-GATK-40 and https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Relationship_between_Ploidy,_Alleles_and_Genotypes)

#### To identify heterozygous sites, sequence reads were
#mapped to genome assembly contigs following the read coverage
#calculation methods above, except that the reference
#contigs used were from genome assemblies prior to removal
#of sequence contaminants and unmerged quality-filtered
#reads were used. bcftools (v.1.10.2) mpileup was used to
#generate raw variant calls using a maximum read coverage
#setting of 50 (default parameters with -d 50, -C 50). Variant
#alleles were identified with bcftools call using the multiallelic
#algorithm, and filtered with bcftools filter to give
#heterozygous alleles with a minimummapping quality of 20 (-
#i’%QUAL>20 && AC/AN 0.5’). This method identifies heterozygous
#sites with balanced allele frequencies and excludes
#sites that are unlikely to be heterozygous with unbalanced
#allele frequencies.
#
#Wolbachia contigs were further filtered to remove high and
#low coverage outliers with coverage greater or less than 1.5
#times the interquartile range beyond median coverage. The
#number of heterozygous alleles detected per contig was tallied
#and contigs were categorized by type. To further test
#whether heterozygous sites likely belonged to the wasp, as
#opposed to multiple sequence variants of exogenous virus,
#heterozygous SNPs were “phased” into haplotype blocks using
#sequence read data. Haplotypes were identified using the
#list of heterozygous alleles and paired-end sequence reads
#mapped to the genome assembly with HapCUT2 (Edge et
#al. 2016). HapCUT2 assembles haplotypes assuming a diploid
#organism, that is, blocks are reported when only two haplotypes
#(“diploid haplotype blocks”) are detected for any given
#stretch of sequence. Therefore, under the scenario of viral
#endogenization, the presence and length of diploid haplotype
#blocks are expected to be similar for scaffolds containing
#virus-derived and BUSCO genes, and near absent for
#Wolbachia scaffolds. In contrast, under the scenario of diverse
#or evolving populations of haploid viral genomes (with a variable
#number of haplotypes for a given sequence), the number
#of diploid haplotype blocks is expected to be near zero
#and much shorter than blocks within scaffolds containing
#BUSCO genes. All of the abovemetrics were used when available
#and in conjunction with each other to provide an overall
#picture of the likelihood that virus-derived genes represent
#EVEs.



# Following the 2021 guidelines from the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (https://github.com/broadinstitute/GATK-for-Microbes), samples were aligned both on reference and on shifted reference. Duplicated reads were identified using Picard MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Variant calling with MuTect2 in microbial mode was performed (27).
